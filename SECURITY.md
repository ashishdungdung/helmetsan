# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, report it privately to the project maintainers.
Do not open a public issue for sensitive vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices

- Rotate compromised API tokens immediately.
- Store credentials in secure environment variables or server-side config.
- Restrict GitHub tokens to minimum repository permissions.

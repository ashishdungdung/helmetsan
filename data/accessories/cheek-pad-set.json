    "description": "<p>Refresh the fit of your Shoei RF-1400 with a new set of Type-E cheek pads. Over time, helmet liners compress and lose their snug fit. These genuine Shoei replacement pads restore the original, secure feel of your helmet. Constructed with Max-Dry material, they absorb and dissipate sweat twice as fast as traditional nylon, keeping you comfortable on long rides.</p>",

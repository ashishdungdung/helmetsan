  "analysis": "The Corsair-X represents Arai's flagship track technology. Its shell uses proprietary structurally netted composites which allow for a lightweight yet incredibly robust structure. The Variable Axis System drastically lowers the visor pivot point, yielding a smoother shell in the critical temporal area. This glancing-off ability is unparalleled in modern helmet engineering.",

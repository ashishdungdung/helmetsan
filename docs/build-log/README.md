## How This Works

Every significant feature gets two documents:

### 🗺️ Implementation Plan

Written **before** building. Contains:

- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
- Phase breakdown with file-level details
- API/schema designs
- Verification plan

### ✅ Walkthrough

Written **after** building. Contains:

- What was built (file tables with links)
- Architecture diagrams
- Key design decisions
- Coverage and capability summary
- What's remaining

> [!TIP]
> New features should follow this same pattern. Future plans and walkthroughs will be added here as the project grows.
